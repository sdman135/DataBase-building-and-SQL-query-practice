# Relational DataBase building, data ingesting + SQL query practice
![](images/[insert_image].png)


For this project I wanted to showcase my ability to make a Relational DataBase.

## What Did I Do?

* Imported .cvs files (data to be ingested later into the DataBase).

* Used Sqlite3 to create and establish connection to DataBase file.

* Constructed and populated tables with a few functions.

* Lastly I (SQL) queried data from the DataBase with conditions and save them to Pandas Dataframes.

## Built With

* Python 3.8
* Jupyter Notebook 6.0.1
* A few imports: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, statsmodels and sklearn
